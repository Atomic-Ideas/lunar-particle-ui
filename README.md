Lunar Particle UI Theme
=========
Dark theme emphasizing theme Universe ! Let's code with stars, matey!
A UI spacial theme for galaxy hitchhikers.

Description
----------------
I've created a new icon set by modifying/creating languages and frameworks icons.
 Some of the visual goals of creating a new dark theme were to put icons after
 the modified/created repository files and folders, put different icons to expanded/collapsed
 folders, differentiating common folder from repo folders - it was achieved.
 The theme also let you feel like coding in space, with a general transparency
 with Earth's vision perspective background, line number (gutter), tree-view and
 not exactly the editor, but the entire IDE background is a space vision of Earth.
 Try it! Some changes are comming, but it is already awesome!


**For a better experience use it with Lunar Particle Syntax**
