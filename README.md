Lunar Particle UI Theme
=========
This is a dark theme with universe emphasize! Let's got coding with stars, buddy!

Description
----------------
I create a new icon set by modifying/creating languages and frameworks icons. Some of the visual goals for creating a new dark theme was to put
icons after the modified/created repository files/folders, put different icons to expanded/collapsed folders, differentiating common folder from repo folders - it was achieved! The theme also let you feel like coding in space, with a general transparency with earth vision perspective background, line number (gutter), tree-view and not exactly the editor, but the entire IDE background is a space vision of Earth. Try it! Some changes is comming, but it is already awesome!


**For a better experience use it with Lunar Particle Syntax**
